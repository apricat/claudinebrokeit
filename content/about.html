Hi! 

I am a web developer by trade. I really like writing elegant code, and I am happiest when solving complicated issues.

In my spare time, I enjoy riding my bike, reading books, identifying trees, eating cereal, baking and watercoloring.

I make a killer maple-syrup pecan pie.

Fun fact: this blog is compiled from Markdown files using jbake. If ever you are curious, the code is available on my GitHub (everything) and Codepen (front end) accounts listed in the sidebar.
