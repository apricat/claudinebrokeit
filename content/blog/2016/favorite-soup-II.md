## Leek, Turnip and Rice Soup

_Time: 45 minutes_

I've been battling a bit of a cold lately, and nothing makes me happier than warm, fagrant soup when I feel like this.

If you're a normal human being, then you used to hate turnip as a kid. When I saw the original recipe, I focused solely on the leeks and rice, and my brain completely made abstraction of the root vegetable required. This until I hit the grocery store aisle and ended up with the unsightly blob in my hand, and that is where I decided to give it a try. I *did* change my mind about brussel sprouts this year, so I decided to give turnips a try as an adult. I'm so glad I did! I owe my mom an apology, _turnips aren't so bad_.

_Adapted from the [New York Times](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12179-leek-turnip-and-rice-soup)_

### Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 3 large leeks, white and green parts, cleaned and sliced
* 1 small turnip, sliced in 1/2 inch cubes
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 6 cups water
* 1 vegetable bouillon cube
* salt and pepper
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 cups of long brown rice
* 2 handfuls of fresh italian parsley, chopped

### Preparation

On medium, heat the oil in a large soup pot and add leek slices. Cook until the leeks begin to soften and add turnip. Stir often and cook for about 5 more minutes, or until leeks are fragrant and turnips are translucent. Add salt, pepper and garlic, cook for another minute. Add water, stock, bay leaf and rice. Set kitchen timer to 30 minutes, reduce heat to low, and go watch some netflix. Add fresh parsley to soup before serving.

### Notes

I usually start by slicing the leek. Then, while the leek is softening in the pot, I cube the turnip. On the side, I also boil the required 6 cups of water in my electric kettle to speed up the soup making process.

Also, Leek and Turnip are best bought, in Quebec, in winter: [calendar](https://www.mapaq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/Publications/FruitsetLegumesduquebec.pdf) (fr)
