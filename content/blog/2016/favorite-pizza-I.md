## Blueberry, Ricotta, Feta and Honey-caramelized Onion Naan Pizza

_Time: 1 hour_
_Makes: 4 individual pizzas_

I know what you're thinking: "That recipe sounds weird" -- and you're right, it is. Thing is, I just spent the weekend solo and decided that that would be the perfect occasion to experiment a little and make a weird-yet-amazingly-delicious sweet-salty-spicy pizza. In fact, this recipe was so good that I just had to make it again the last night for my boyfriend to taste.

### Dough

If you've never made dough, I highly suggest you try your hand at it; it's quite easy and rewarding! It requires very little effort and there's convenient _waiting_ times that you can use to prep the toppings, drink beer and eat chips :)

* 1 tbs dry yeast
* 1 tbs sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 125ml lukewarm water
* 2 cups non-bleached flour
* 1 tbs olive oil

### Pizza Toppings

* 1/2 cup ricotta cheese
* 1/2 cup feta cheese, finely crumbled
* 1 cup frozen blueberries
* 1 tsp honey
* 1 tsp red pepper flakes
* 1 red onion, thinly sliced
* 1 tsp olive oil
* pinch of salt

### Preparation

Get the water to about 37 degrees celsius. Conveniently, this is approximately the same temperature as your body's! So you can get a close-enough temperature straight from the tap by wetting your finger, dropping it under your tongue, adjusting the tap temperature and repeating the operation until the water feels neither too hot or too cold under the tongue. Once satisfying, pour 125ml into a large bowl. Stir in yeast and sugar and set aside for 15 minutes**.

Once the yeast has been activated, stir in oil, salt and flour. Mix using hands once it becomes too hard. The resulting ball of dough should be sticky, and you can add flour and/or water to the mix if the texture isn't satisfactory. Wait 15 minutes. Knead the dough 20 times and separate into 4 equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to get the balls to approximately the surface size of your frying pan. Set aside.

Pre-heat oven to 400Â°F. 

Slice onion. Heat oil on low-heat in non-stick frying pan and add onion, red pepper flakes. Cook until onions are translucent. Add honey and fry another few minutes until onions are caramelized and fragrant. Remove onions from pan, and add start frying, one by one, the pizza doughs. Flip when each side is golden and crispy.

Once the pizza doughs are ready, place them on baking sheets. Spread the ricotta over the doughs, and add feta, caramelized onions, and blueberries on top.

Bake for about 10 minutes or until the dough is crispy and the toppings are hot. Sprinkle some salt on top before serving.

** Note that if after 15 minutes the yeast mixture hasn't "foamed" then you should just throw out the mixture and try again; that happens when the water is too warm, too cold, or if the yeast is too old.
