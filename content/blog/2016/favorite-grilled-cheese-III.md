## Guacamole Grilled Cheese

_Time: 30 minutes_
_Makes: 4 sandwiches_

Every once in a while, you ask your partner what he/she would like for dinner and they blurt out something so weird that you just have to make it. This is what happened to me yesterday when I inquired about what we should eat and got _avocado grilled cheese_ as an answer. Turns out its quite popular -- as proven by a quick internet search -- and definitely very tasty, making this one of my favorite grilled cheese recipe of all time. 

### Guacamole

* 1 avocado
* 1/2 roma tomato, chopped
* 2 tbs red onion, chopped
* 1 handful fresh cilantro, chopped
* juice from 1 lime
* salt and pepper


### Grilled Cheese

* 8 slices of cheddar cheese
* 8 slices of whole wheat bread -- _I used a small loaf of Harvest Bread, which is a mix of roasted pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds, millet and poppy seeds_
* butter, spread on one side of each bread slices


### Preparation

Prepare guacamole first, as it takes the longest to prepare. Heat up non-stick frying pan on medium. Add 1/2 of slices of bread, butter side down. Add two slices of cheese and 1/4 of guacamole mixture on top of each slice of bread. Top with slice of bread, butter side up. Flip once the bottom slice is golden brown, and serve once both sides are roasted.
